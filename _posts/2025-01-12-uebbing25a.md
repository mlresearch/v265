title: Investigating the Impact of Feature Reduction for Deep Learning-based Seasonal
  Sea Ice Forecasting
openreview: 7TwvcPAyxX
abstract: With the state-of-the-art IceNet model, deep learning has contributed to
  an important aspect of climate research by leveraging a range of climate inputs
  to provide accurate forecasts of Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC). The deep learning
  subfield of eXplainable AI (XAI) has gained enormous attention in order to gauge
  feature importance of neural networks, for instance by leveraging network gradients.
  In recent work, an XAI study of the IceNet was conducted, using gradient saliency
  maps to interrogate its feature importance. A majority of XAI studies provide information
  about feature importance as revealed by the XAI method, but rarely provide thorough
  analysis of effects from reducing the number of input variables.  In this paper,
  we train versions of the IceNet with drastically reduced numbers of input features
  according to results of XAI and investigate the effects on the sea ice predictions,
  on average and with respect to specific events. Our results provide evidence that
  the model generally performs better when less features are used, but in case of
  anomalous events, a larger number of features is beneficial. We believe our thorough
  study of the IceNet in terms of feature importance revealed by XAI may give inspiration
  for other deep learning-based problem scenarios and application domains.
