title: 'PePR: Performance Per Resource Unit as a Metric to Promote Small-scale Deep
  Learning'
openreview: Pb47B5t0pr
software: https://github.com/saintslab/PePR
abstract: The recent advances in deep learning (DL) have been accelerated by access
  to large-scale data and compute. These large-scale resources have been used to train
  progressively larger models which are resource intensive in terms of compute, data,
  energy, and carbon emissions. These costs are becoming a new type of entry barrier
  to researchers and practitioners with limited access to resources at such scale,
  particularly in the Global South. In this work, we take a comprehensive look at
  the landscape of existing DL models for medical image analysis tasks and demonstrate
  their usefulness in settings where resources are limited. To account for the resource
  consumption of DL models, we introduce a novel measure to estimate the performance
  per resource unit, which we call the PePR score. Using a diverse family of 131 unique
  DL architectures (spanning $1M$ to $130M$ trainable parameters) and three medical
  image datasets, we capture trends about the performance-resource trade-offs. In
  applications like medical image analysis, we argue that small-scale, specialized  models
  are better than striving for large-scale models. Furthermore, we show that using
  existing pretrained models that are fine-tuned on new data can significantly reduce
  the computational resources and data required compared to training models from scratch.
  We hope this work will encourage the community to focus on improving AI equity by
  developing methods and models with smaller resource footprints.
