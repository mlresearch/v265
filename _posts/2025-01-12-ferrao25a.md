title: World Model Agents with Change-Based Intrinsic Motivation

abstract: Sparse reward environments pose a significant challenge for reinforcement
  learning due to the scarcity of feedback. Intrinsic motivation and transfer learning
  have emerged as promising strategies to address this issue. Change Based Exploration
  Transfer (CBET), a technique that combines these two approaches for model-free algorithms,
  has shown potential in addressing sparse feedback but its effectiveness with modern
  algorithms remains understudied. This paper provides an adaptation of CBET for world
  model algorithms like DreamerV3 and compares the performance of DreamerV3 and IMPALA
  agents, both with and without CBET, in the sparse reward environments of Crafter
  and Minigrid. Our tabula rasa results highlight the possibility of CBET improving
  DreamerV3â€™s returns in Crafter but the algorithm attains a suboptimal policy in
  Minigrid with CBET further reducing returns. In the same vein, our transfer learning
  experiments show that pre-training DreamerV3 with intrinsic rewards does not immediately
  lead to a policy that maximizes extrinsic rewards in Minigrid. Overall, our results
  suggest that CBET provides a positive impact on DreamerV3 in more complex environments
  like Crafter but may be detrimental in environments like Minigrid. In the latter
  case, the behaviours promoted by CBET in DreamerV3 may not align with the task objectives
  of the environment, leading to reduced returns and suboptimal policies.
