title: Deep Active Latent Surfaces for Medical Geometries
openreview: TP0ASAlrp2
abstract: Shape priors have long been known to be effective when reconstructing 3D
  shapes from noisy or incomplete data.  When using a deep-learning based shape representation,
  this often involves learning a latent representation, which can be either in the
  form of a single global vector or of multiple local ones. The latter allows more
  flexibility but is prone to overfitting.  In this paper, we advocate a hybrid approach
  representing shapes in terms of 3D meshes with a separate latent vector at each
  vertex. During training the latent vectors are constrained to have the same value,
  which avoids overfitting. For inference, the latent vectors are updated independently
  while imposing spatial regularization constraints. We show that this gives us both
  flexibility and generalization capabilities, which we demonstrate on several medical
  image processing tasks.
