title: Locally orderless networks
openreview: JNxddbPPWt
abstract: We present Locally Orderless Networks (LON) and the theoretical foundation
  that links them to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Scale-space histograms,
  and measurement theory. The key elements are a regular sampling of the bias and
  the derivative of the activation function. We compare LON, CNN, and Scale-space
  histograms on prototypical single-layer networks. We show how LON and CNN can emulate
  each other and how LON expands the set of functions computable to non-linear functions
  such as squaring. We demonstrate simple networks that illustrate the improved performance
  of LON over CNN on simple tasks for estimating the gradient magnitude squared, for
  regressing shape area and perimeter lengths, and for explainability of individual
  pixelsâ€™ influence on the result.
