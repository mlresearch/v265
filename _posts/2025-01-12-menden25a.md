title: Bounds on the Generalization Error in Active Learning
openreview: KcBMGkip79
abstract: We establish empirical risk minimization principles for active learning
  by  deriving a family of upper bounds on the generalization error. Aligning with
  empirical observations, the bounds suggest that superior query algorithms can be
  obtained by combining both informativeness and representativeness query strategies,
  where the latter is assessed using integral probability metrics. To facilitate the
  use of these bounds in application, we systematically link diverse active learning
  scenarios, characterized by their loss functions and hypothesis classes to their
  corresponding upper bounds. Our results show that regularization techniques used
  to constraint the complexity of various hypothesis classes are sufficient conditions
  to ensure the validity of the bounds. The present work enables principled construction
  and empirical quality-evaluation of query algorithms in active learning.
