title: Learning incomplete factorization preconditioners for GMRES
openreview: ZF64XEUgHm
software: https://github.com/paulhausner/neural-incomplete-factorization
abstract: Incomplete LU factorizations of sparse matrices are widely used as preconditioners
  in Krylov subspace methods to speed up solving linear systems. Unfortunately, computing
  the preconditioner itself can be time-consuming and sensitive to hyper-parameters.
  Instead, we replace the hand-engineered algorithm with a graph neural network that
  is trained to approximate the matrix factorization directly. To apply the output
  of the neural network as a preconditioner, we propose an output activation function
  that guarantees that the predicted factorization is invertible. Further, applying
  a graph neural network architecture allows us to ensure that the output itself is
  sparse which is desirable from a computational standpoint. We theoretically analyze
  and empirically evaluate different loss functions to train the learned preconditioners
  and show their effectiveness in decreasing the number of GMRES iterations and improving
  the spectral properties on synthetic data. The code is available at https://github.com/paulhausner/neural-incomplete-factorization.
