title: Graph Counterfactual Explainable AI via Latent Space Traversal
openreview: Pyqnc9eWhB
abstract: Explaining the predictions of a deep neural network is a nontrivial task,
  yet high-quality explanations for predictions are often a prerequisite for practitioners
  to trust these models. \textit{Counterfactual explanations} aim to explain predictions
  by finding the “nearest” in-distribution alternative input whose prediction changes
  in a pre-specified way. However, it remains an open question how to define this
  nearest alternative input, whose solution depends on both the domain (e.g. images,
  graphs, tabular data, etc.) and the specific application considered. For graphs,
  this problem is complicated i) by their discrete nature, as opposed to the continuous
  nature of state-of-the-art graph classifiers; and ii) by the node permutation group
  acting on the graphs. We propose a method to generate counterfactual explanations
  for any differentiable black-box graph classifier, utilizing a case-specific permutation
  equivariant graph variational autoencoder. We generate counterfactual explanations
  in a continuous fashion by traversing the latent space of the autoencoder across
  the classification boundary of the classifier, allowing for seamless integration
  of discrete graph structure and continuous graph attributes. We empirically validate
  the approach on three graph datasets, showing that our model is consistently high
  performing and more robust than the baselines.
