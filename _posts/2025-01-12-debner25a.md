abstract: Audio holds significant amount of information about our surroundings. It
  can be used to navigate, assess threats, communicate, as a source of curiosity,
  and to separate the sources of different sounds. Still, these rich properties of
  audio are not fully utilized by current video game agents.  We use spatial audio
  libraries in combination with deep reinforcement learning to allow agents to observe
  their surroundings and to navigate in their environment using audio cues. In general,
  game engines support rendering audio for one agent only. Using a hide-and-seek scenario
  in our experimentation we show how support for multiple concurrent listeners can
  be used to parallelize the runtime operation and to enable using multiple agents.
  Further, we analyze the effects of audio environment complexity to demonstrate the
  scalability of our approach.
