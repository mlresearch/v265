title: Exploring Segment Anything Foundation Models for Out of Domain Crevasse Drone
  Image Segmentation
openreview: CGkyjTXomz
abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of Segment Anything (SAM) foundation
  models for segmenting crevasses in Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images of glaciers.
  We evaluate the performance of the SAM and SAM 2 models on ten high-resolution UAV
  images from Svalbard, Norway. Each SAM model has been evaluated in inference mode
  without additional fine-tuning. Using both automated and manual prompting methods,
  we compare the segmentation quantitatively using Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) and
  Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics. Results show that the SAM 2 Hiera-L model
  outperforms other variants, achieving average DSC and IoU scores of 0.43 and 0.28
  respectively with automated prompting. However, the overall off-the-shelf performance
  suggests that further improvements are still required to enable glaciologists to
  examine crevasse patterns and associated physical processes (e.g. iceberg calving),
  indicating the need for further fine-tuning to address domain shift challenges.
  Our results highlight the potential of segmentation foundation models for specialised
  remote sensing applications while also identifying limitations in applying them
  to high-resolution UAV images, as well as ways to enhance further model performance
  on out-of-domain glacier imagery, such as few-shot and weakly supervised learning
  techniques.
