title: 'Learning anomalies from graph: predicting compute node failures on HPC clusters'
openreview: SPRdfOkuHw
abstract: Today, high-performance computing (HPC) systems play a crucial role in advancing
  artificial intelligence. Nevertheless, the estimated global data center electricity
  consumption in 2022 was around 1% of the final global electricity demand. Therefore,
  as HPC systems advance towards Exascale computing, research is required to ensure
  their growth is sustainable and environmentally friendly. Data from infrastructure
  monitoring can be leveraged to predict downtimes, ensure these are treated in time,
  and increase the overall systemâ€™s utilization. In this paper, we compare four machine-learning
  approaches, three of them based on graph embeddings, to predict compute node downtimes.
  The experiments were performed with data from Marconi 100, a tier-0 production supercomputer
  at CINECA in Bologna, Italy. Our results show that the machine learning models can
  accurately predict downtime, matching current state-of-the-art models.
