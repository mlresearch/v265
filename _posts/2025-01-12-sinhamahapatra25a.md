title: Zero-Shot Open-Vocabulary OOD Object Detection and Grounding using Vision Language
  Models
openreview: Q2wVVeOpz8
abstract: Automated driving involves complex perception tasks that require a precise
  understanding of diverse traffic scenarios and confident navigation. Traditional
  data-driven algorithms trained on closed-set data often fail to generalize upon
  out-of-distribution (OOD) and edge cases. Recently, Large Vision Language Models
  (LVLMs) have shown potential in integrating the reasoning capabilities of language
  models to understand and reason about complex driving scenes, aiding generalization
  to OOD scenarios. However, grounding such OOD objects still remains a challenging
  task. In this work, we propose an automated framework zPROD, for zero-shot promptable
  open vocabulary OOD object detection, segmentation, and grounding in autonomous
  driving. We leverage LVLMs with visual grounding capabilities, eliminating the need
  for lengthy text communication and providing precise indications of OOD objects
  in the scene or on the track of the ego-centric vehicle. We evaluate our approach
  on OOD datasets from existing road anomaly segmentation benchmarks such as SMIYC
  and Fishyscapes. Our zero-shot approach shows superior performance on RoadAnomaly
  and RoadObstacle and comparable results on the Fishyscapes subset as compared to
  supervised models and acts a baseline for future zero-shot methods based on open
  vocabulary OOD detection.
