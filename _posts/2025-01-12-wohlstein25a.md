title: Toward Learning Distributions of Distributions
openreview: rIQCKH0He8
abstract: We propose a novel generative deep learning architecture based on generative
  moment matching networks. The objective of our model is to learn a distribution
  over distributions and generate new sample distributions following the (possibly
  complex) distribution of training data. We derive a custom loss function for our
  model based on the maximum mean discrepancy test. Our model is evaluated on different
  datasets where we investigate the influence of hyperparameters on performance.
