title: 'FreqRISE: Explaining time series using frequency masking'
openreview: JBH3mtjG9I
software: https://github.com/theabrusch/FreqRISE
abstract: Time series data is fundamentally important for many critical domains such
  as healthcare, finance, and climate, where explainable models are necessary for
  safe automated decision-making. To develop explainable artificial intelligence in
  these domains therefore implies explaining salient information in the time series.
  Current methods for obtaining saliency maps assumes localized information in the
  raw input space. In this paper, we argue that the salient information of a number
  of time series is more likely to be localized in the frequency domain. We propose
  FreqRISE, which uses masking based methods to produce explanations in the frequency
  and time-frequency domain, and outperforms strong baselines across a number of tasks.
