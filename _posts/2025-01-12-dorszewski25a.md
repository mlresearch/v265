title: Connecting Concept Convexity and Human-Machine Alignment in Deep Neural Networks
openreview: e1dpokhi0c
abstract: Understanding how neural networks align with human cognitive processes is
  a crucial step toward developing more interpretable and reliable AI systems. Motivated
  by theories of human cognition, this study examines the relationship between convexity
  in neural network representations and human-machine alignment based on behavioral
  data. We identify a correlation between these two dimensions in pretrained and fine-tuned
  vision transformer models. Our findings suggest the convex regions formed in latent
  spaces of neural networks to some extent align with human-defined categories and
  reflect the similarity relations humans use in cognitive tasks. While optimizing
  for alignment generally enhances convexity, increasing convexity through fine-tuning
  yields inconsistent effects on alignment, which suggests a complex relationship
  between the two. This study presents a first step toward understanding the relationship
  between the convexity of latent representations and human-machine alignment.
