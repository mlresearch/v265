title: 'Hallucination Detection in LLMs: Fast and Memory-Efficient Finetuned Models'
openreview: 8T8QkDsuO9
software: https://github.com/Gabriel-Arteaga/LLM-Ensemble
abstract: 'Uncertainty estimation is a necessary component when implementing AI in
  high-risk settings, such as autonomous cars, medicine, or insurances. Large Language
  Models (LLMs) have seen a surge in popularity in recent years, but they are subject
  to hallucinations, which may cause serious harm in high-risk settings. Despite their
  success, LLMs are expensive to train and run: they need a large amount of computations
  and memory, preventing the use of ensembling methods in practice. In this work,
  we present a novel method that allows for fast and memory-friendly training of LLM
  ensembles. We show that the resulting ensembles can detect hallucinations and are
  a viable approach in practice as only one GPU is needed for training and inference.'
