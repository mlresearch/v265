title: One-Class SVM-guided Negative Sampling for Enhanced Contrastive Learning
openreview: XCUzATsVdU
software: https://github.com/DJ-CHB/MiOC-Official
abstract: Recent studies on contrastive learning have emphasized carefully sampling
  and mixing negative samples. This study introduces a novel and improved approach
  for generating synthetic negatives. We propose a new method using One-Class Support
  Vector Machine (OCSVM) to guide in the selection process before mixing named as  **Mixing
  OCSVM negatives (MiOC)**. Our results show that our approach creates more meaningful
  embeddings, which lead to better classification performance. We implement our method
  using publicly available datasets (Imagenet100, Cifar10, Cifar100, Cinic10, and
  STL10). We observed that MiOC exhibit favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art
  methods across these datasets. By presenting a novel approach, this study emphasizes
  the exploration of alternative mixing techniques that expand the sampling space
  beyond the conventional confines of hard negatives produced by the ranking of the
  dot product.
