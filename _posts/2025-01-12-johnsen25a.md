title: 'SPARDACUS SafetyCage: A new misclassification detector'
openreview: 3FswRo4Lhj
abstract: Given the increasing adoption of machine learning techniques in society
  and industry, it is important to put procedures in place that can infer and signal
  whether the prediction of an ML model may be unreliable. This is not only relevant
  for ML specialists, but also for laypersons who may be end-users. In this work,
  we present a new method for flagging possible misclassifications from a feed-forward
  neural network in a general multi-class problem, called SPARDA-enabled Classification
  Uncertainty Scorer (SPARDACUS). For each class and layer, the probability distribution
  functions of the activations for both correctly and wrongly classified samples are
  recorded. Using a Sparse Difference Analysis (SPARDA) approach, an optimal projection
  along the direction maximizing the Wasserstein distance enables $p$-value computations
  to confirm or reject the class prediction. Importantly, while most existing methods
  act on the output layer only, our method can in addition be applied on the hidden
  layers in the neural network, thus being useful in applications, such as feature
  extraction, that necessarily exploit the intermediate (hidden) layers. We test our
  method on both a well-performing and under-performing classifier, on different datasets,
  and compare with other previously published approaches. Notably, while achieving
  performance on par with two state-of-the-art-level methods, we significantly extend
  in flexibility and applicability. We further find, for the models and datasets chosen,
  that the output layer is indeed the most valuable for misclassification detection,
  and adding information from previous layers does not necessarily improve performance
  in such cases.
