title: Familiarity-Based Open-Set Recognition Under Adversarial Attacks
openreview: 14ptPJP6fG
abstract: Open-set recognition (OSR), the identification of novel categories, can
  be a critical component when deploying classification models in real-world applications.
  Recent work has shown that familiarity-based scoring rules such as the Maximum Softmax
  Probability (MSP) or the Maximum Logit Score (MLS) are strong baselines when the
  closed-set accuracy is high. However, one of the potential weaknesses of familiarity-based
  OSR are adversarial attacks. Here, we study gradient-based adversarial attacks on
  familiarity scores for both types of attacks, False Familiarity and False Novelty
  attacks, and evaluate their effectiveness in informed and uninformed settings on
  TinyImageNet. Furthermore, we explore how novel and familiar samples react to adversarial
  attacks and formulate the adversarial reaction score as an alternative OSR scoring
  rule, which shows a high correlation with the MLS familiarity score.
