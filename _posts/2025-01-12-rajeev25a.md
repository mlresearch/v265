title: Predicting Oligomeric states of Fluorescent Proteins using Mamba
openreview: KaZzDtUeJY

abstract: Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are essential tools in biomedical imaging, known
  for their ability to absorb and emit light, thereby allowing visualization of biological
  processes. Understanding the oligomeric state is crucial, as monomeric forms are
  often preferred in applications to minimize potential artifacts and prevent interference
  with cellular functions. Experimental methods to find the oligomeric state can be
  time-consuming and expensive. Most of the current computational model is CPU-based,
  limiting their speed and scalability. This paper studies the effectiveness of GPU-based
  deep-learning models in predicting the oligomeric states of fluorescent proteins
  directly from their amino acid sequences, specifically focusing on the Mamba architecture.
  Various protein-specific augmentations were also employed to enhance the modelâ€™s
  generalizability. Our results indicate that the mamba-based model achieves accuracy
  and F1 score close to 90% and an MCC value of 0.8 with in predicting the oligomeric
  states of fluorescent proteins directly from its amino acid sequence. The code used
  in this study is available at [GitHub repository](https://github.com/smlab-niser/FluorMamba).
