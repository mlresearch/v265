title: Enhancing Fault Detection in Optical Networks with Conditional Denoising Diffusion
  Probabilistic Models
openreview: Bkm9j80WTj
abstract: The scarcity of high-quality anomalous data often poses a challenge in establishing
  effective automated fault detection schemes. This study addresses the issue in the
  context of fault detection in optical fibers using reflectometry data, where noise
  can obscure the detection of certain known anomalies. We specifically investigate
  whether classes containing samples of low quality can be boosted with synthetically
  generated examples characterized by high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Specifically,
  we employ a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (cDDPM) to generate
  synthetic data for such classes. It works by learning the characteristics of high
  SNRs from anomaly classes that are less frequently affected by significant noise.
  The boosted dataset is compared with a baseline dataset (without the augmented data)
  by   training an anomaly classifier and measuring the performances on a hold-out
  dataset populated only with high quality traces for all classes. We observe a significant
  improved performance (Precision, Recall, and F1 Scores) for the noise affected training
  classes proving the success of our methods.
