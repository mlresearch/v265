title: Interpretable Function Approximation with Gaussian Processes in Value-Based
  Model-Free Reinforcement Learning

abstract: Estimating value functions in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for continuous
  spaces is challenging. While traditional function approximators, such as linear
  models, offer interpretability, they are limited in their complexity. In contrast,
  deep neural networks can model more complex functions but are less interpretable.
  Gaussian Process (GP) models bridge this gap by offering interpretable uncertainty
  estimates while modeling complex nonlinear functions. This work introduces a Bayesian
  nonparametric framework using GPs, including Sparse Variational (SVGP) and Deep
  GPs (DGP), for off-policy and on-policy learning. Results on popular classic control
  environments show that SVGPs/DGPs outperform linear models but converge slower than
  their neural network counterparts. Nevertheless, they do provide valuable insights
  when it comes to uncertainty estimation and interpretability for RL.
