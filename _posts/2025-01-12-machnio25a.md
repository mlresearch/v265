title: Deep Learning for Localization of White Matter Lesions in Neurological Diseases
openreview: ea0YJaJShO
software: https://github.com/juliamachnio/WMHLocalization
abstract: White Matter (WM) lesions, commonly observed as hyperintensities on FLAIR
  MRIs or hypointensities on T1-weighted images, are associated with neurological
  diseases. The spatial distribution of these lesions is linked to an increased risk
  of developing neurological conditions, emphasizing the need for location-based analyses.
  Traditional manual identification and localization of WM lesions are labor-intensive
  and time-consuming, highlighting the need for automated solutions. In this study,
  we propose novel deep learning-based methods for automated WM lesion segmentation
  and localization. Our approach utilizes state-of-the-art models to concurrently
  segment WM lesions and anatomical WM regions, providing detailed insights into their
  distribution within the brain’s anatomical structure. By applying k-means clustering
  to the regional WM lesion load, distinct subject groups are identified to be associated
  with various neurological conditions, validating the method’s alignment with established
  clinical findings. The robustness and adaptability of our method across different
  scanner types and imaging protocols make it a valuable tool for research and clinical
  practice, offering potential improvements in diagnostic efficiency and patient care.
