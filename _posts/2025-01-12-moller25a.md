title: 'NEMt: Fast Targeted Explanations for Medical Image Models via Neural Explanation
  Masks'
openreview: PenPJYfmaA
abstract: A fundamental barrier to the adoption of AI systems in clinical practice
  is the insufficient transparency of AI decision-making. The field of Explainable
  Artificial Intelligence (XAI) seeks to provide human-interpretable explanations
  for a given AI model. The recently proposed Neural Explanation Mask (NEM) framework
  is the first XAI method to explain learned representations with high accuracy at
  real-time speed.  NEM transforms a given differentiable model into a self-explaining
  system by augmenting it with a neural network-based explanation module. This module
  is trained in an unsupervised manner to output occlusion-based explanations for
  the original model. However, the current framework does not consider labels associated
  with the inputs. This makes it unsuitable for many important tasks in the medical
  domain that require explanations specific to particular output dimensions, such
  as pathology discovery, disease severity regression, and multi-label data classification.
  In this work, we address this issue by introducing a loss function for training
  explanation modules incorporating labels. It steers explanations toward target labels
  alongside an integrated smoothing operator, which reduces artifacts in the explanation
  masks. We validate the resulting  Neural Explanation Masks with target labels (NEMt)
  framework on public databases of lung radiographs and skin images. The obtained
  results are superior to the state-of-the-art XAI methods in terms of explanation
  relevancy mass, complexity, and sparseness. Moreover, the explanation generation
  is several hundred times faster, allowing for real-time clinical applications. The
