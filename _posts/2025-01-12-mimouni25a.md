title: 'Deep Q-Learning with Whittle Index for Contextual Restless Bandits: Application
  to Email Recommender Systems'
openreview: alnaQJdBNs
abstract: 'In this paper, we introduce DQWIC, a novel algorithm that combines Deep
  Reinforcement Learning and Whittle index theory within the Contextual Restless Multi-Armed
  Bandit framework for the discounted criterion. DQWIC is designed to learn in evolving
  environments typical of real-world applications, such as recommender systems, where  user
  preferences and environmental dynamics evolve over time. In particular, we apply
  DQWIC to the problem of optimizing email recommendations, where it tackles the dual
  challenges of enhancing content relevance and reducing spam messages, thereby addressing
  ethical concerns related to intrusive emailing. The algorithm leverages two neural
  networks: a Q-network for approximating action-value functions and a Whittle-network
  for estimating Whittle indices, both of which integrate contextual features to inform
  decision-making. In addition, the inclusion of context allows us to handle many
  heterogeneous users in a scalable way. The learning process occurs through a two
  time scale stochastic approximation, with the Q-network updated frequently to minimize
  the loss between predicted and target Q-values, and the Whittle-network updated
  on a slower time scale. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted experiments
  in partnership with a company specializing in digital marketing. Our results, derived
  from both synthetic and real-world data, show that DQWIC outperforms existing email
  marketing baselines.'
